2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence

Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

Example 1:
Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
Output: 2

Explanation:
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

Example 2:
Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]
Output: 0

Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.

Example 3:
Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]
Output: 1

Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".
